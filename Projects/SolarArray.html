  	  <h1>Solar Array</h1>
  	  <p>As the electrical director of PrISUm, I lead development of the array for the solar car, a rather
		 important part of the project. I lead manufacture of the silicon array pictured here on Penumbra, and
		 lead design and devlopment for the experimental array going on our next solar car. I learned a lot about semiconductor
		 physics, as well as solar energy in general, as Iowa State only gets into high level solar cells junior/senior year,
		 and I was thrown in headfirst as a freshman. I learned various diodes and protections against the cells, as well
		 as learning how to design a solar system as a whole, from power in, to the boost to a usable voltage, to storage.
		 Various solar cells of experimental chemistries were used, as well as solar design resources ranging from professional
		 companies, to hobby equipment found on campus.
