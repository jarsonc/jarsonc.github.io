  	  <h1>Workiva</h1>
  	  <p>At Workiva, I worked as a software development intern in release management. I helped create python scripts and fix bugs
			related to the nightly release program that Workiva stuck to. As their software gets updates and deployments every night, it was
			important to automate as much as possible. I had my first taste of backend engineering at Workiva, and I was hooked. Doing database
			analysis and fidning out how to maniupulate and analyze data was a fun learning experience to me that lead to me diving headfirst
			into similar tasks and roles in my later internships. I also was able to develop my coding abilities there, especially my python chops,
			learning about automation and the role it takes in software development.
