  	  <h1>Spreetail</h1>
  	  <p>At Spreetail, I worked as a software engineer, developing in house accounting tooling for use in their accounting department. As part of that,
			I specialized in Backend development, working through their SQL databases to agregate, visualize, and analyze their data. This lead to me taking
			on additional responsibility, creating a resell costing system that took return items marked good for resell, and finding out a target price
			so Spreetail could resell the item and recoup some revenue from the waste. I learned quite a bit about backend development, and also about devops,
			since Spreetail had a very exciting strategy of letting people loose on projects. It was quite a bit of a learning curve, but it lead to an exciting
			time learning many new things.
